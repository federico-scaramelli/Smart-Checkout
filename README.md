# Smart-Checkout
An application that implements a simple automated system that replaces the role of the cashier in a supermarket. 

The software presented can be considered an alpha version limited to a small application domain, which verifies the functionality and usefulness of the system within the supermarket itself.

The software was developed using MATLAB during the Elaborazione delle Immagini (Image Processing) course at UniMiB.
